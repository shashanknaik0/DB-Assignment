<h2>1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.</h2>
<p>Based on the schema diagram:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The "Product" entity has foreign key "category_id" that references the primary key "id" in the "Product_Category" entity.</li>
    <li>The "Product" and "Product_Category" entities has many-to-one relationship. That is, many products can belong to same category</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?</h2>
<p>
    To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, we can use foreign key constraint.In the provided schema diagram, the "category_id" column in the "Product" table is a foreign key that references the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table. This ensures the referential integrity.
